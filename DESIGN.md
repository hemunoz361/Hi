I decided it would be best to make a new file everytime I wanted to navigate from the homescreen. I felt this would make my thought process less convoluted and make it easier to troubleshoot. That being said, I did just make one CSS file for styling and seperated each section by comments.

I had a few JavaScript functions. The main one was the autocomplete search bar. By putting in a list of keywords, the user can type whatever they want, but they will have an option of words to choose from. toLowerCase() allowed for their typing to not be case sensitive that way they are able to find a product without typing in the whole phrase with exact capilatization.

The other JavaScript element was an alert and event listener for when the purchase button was pushed to thank the buyer.

The side bar was made folding in a table within a table. By doing this, it allowed for each category to have several subcategories. href was used extensively on all of these subcategories, searchbar results, and images to all navigate to the same single product page.

Each product had to have its own page because otherwise there would be much more difficult to navigate to it from so many different areas. Each page includes the header to still have the search bar and logo to navigate home. Each of these pages is really just design elements.

Bootstrap was used to make the carosel slideshow. For this I went to the Bootstrap website and used a piece of code there but just filled in the gaps with my own images and sizing.

The CSS mainly involved margin and padding editigng to move something around. Color and backhround were utlized to make thing look nicer and give a purple color scheme. Small deatil such as cursor:pointer are helpful because they indicate when things are interactive.
