This project is meant to mimic a pet supply store. I want to make an e-commerce website because I feel that know how to make one could have some practical uses. Also, I wanted to be able to practice using Bootstrap and I felt that this was one of the best ways to do so. I am happy with how it looks and and enjoyed coding in HTML/CSS/Javascript.

When the user first clicks on index.html, they are brought to the home screen. First thing is a big Bootstrap carosel of pictures. This is interactive so the user can click through. Scrolling further down, the user will see featured products. There are holiday products and products on sale. When the user drags their mouse over the product it moves to indicate it can be clicked on.

All the pictures can be clicked on and lead the user to a new page with more deatils about the products including a rating out of five stars and the option to purchase. If the user chooses to purchase the product, then they are thanked. The user can go back to the home page by clicking on the left hand logo, or by navigating the search bar.

The search bar allows for the user to type and try to find a specific product. A dropdown menu pops up and they can choose which product to navigate to from there.

There is also a side bar menu and this menu allows the user to find a product through various categories including type of animal, food, equipment, toys, and more.

Hope you enjoy your shopping experience at The Pet Zone!
